# Dectalk-API

[Built using Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com)

1. Download the repository (Dectalk-API-master.zip) and extract to the htdoc path of your HTTP client (XAMPP/Apache etc).

2. (Optional) Rename the folder to what you'd like.

3. You can now access the API at:

    `{LOCAL_IP}/{FOLDER_NAME}/api/say/{WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY}`

    E.g:

    `192.168.1.61/dectalk/api/say/hello`

4. A .wav file containing your message will be downloaded, phonemes are accepted ([:nh] etc).
